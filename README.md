# Kabisa coding assignment

This is a coding assignment that I did to an interview at Kabisa.

# The assignment

The main screen of your application should display a random quote retrieved from a web API and provide some means to display the next random quote. The application should also incorporate at least one native device feature like GPS, accelerometer, native sharing, etc and handle a lack of network connectivity gracefully. All other requirements are up to you! You can be as creative as you like.

- Fetch quotes from multiple APIâ€™s, racing for the fastest response (eg:
http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/api,
https://pprathameshmore.github.io/QuoteGarden/).
- Handle offline gracefully, for example falling back on a set of local hardcoded or cached quotes.
- Allow user to rate quotes (backend not required).
- Create a slideshow of random quotes being shown.


## Installation
